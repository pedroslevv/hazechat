## Weather Bot [![Level: medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-medium-orange.svg)](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy)

The weather bot tells you what the weather is like in any city it has data for! 

[Download code](https://github.com/mikaelsvensson/helloworld-telegram-chat-bot/archive/weather.zip)

It uses the [openweathermap](http://api.openweathermap.org) api.

Further improvements:

- Sending in the time (today, tomorrow or 5days)
- Responding with emoticons if it is sunny or cloudy ... 

## Pokemon, Starwars or Superhero Picture Bot [![Level: hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-hard-red.svg)](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy)

[![API: Pokemons](https://img.shields.io/badge/APIs-pokemons-1abc9c.svg)](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy)
[![Fuzzy matching](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fuzzy%20matching-fuzzywuzzy-1abc9c.svg)](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy)

This example bot takes what you type and matches it with a pokemon name. It will then respond with the pokemon picture.

This is using a [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) through a python library called [pokebase](https://github.com/GregHilmes/pokebase)

Do not like pokemos? Other APIs that could be used:
* [Marvel's superhero API](https://developer.marvel.com/docs)
* [Starwars API](https://swapi.co) and respective python wrapper [swapi-python](https://github.com/phalt/swapi-python)

Write a bot that sends back a happy smiley face if the user seems to be happy.

Libraries for this?

## Calculator Bot

A bot that when given an operation it solves it. e.g.

    4*10

the bot should respond

    40

if the mesage does not match <number><operation><number> then it should say:

    I am sorry <username>, I cannot calculate that :(

See [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html).
